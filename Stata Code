** Loading the data
 insheet using "C:\Users\kerjmbuthia\Desktop\School 3.2\Research Methods\Project\DATA.csv"
 
 ** Declaring the data is Time Series
tsset year, yearly

 ** Obtaining the summary of the statistics
 tabstat gdp inflation manufacturing gni, statistics( mean max min sd var cv skewness kurtosis ) columns(variables)
 
** Establishing the trend of our variables
woway(tsline    manufacturing)
twoway(tsline  gdp)
twoway(tsline  inflation)
twoway(tsline   gni)

* Testing for stationarity in all variables
dfgls  gdp
dfgls  inflation
dfgls  gni
dfgls  manufacturing

** Differencing the dependent variable
gen dmanumufacturing = manufacturing- l.manufacturing
dfgls  dmanufacturing

** Testing for serial correlation in residuals
regress  dmanufacturing gdp inflation gni

The p-value, 0.6424, is greater than the standard critical value of 0.05, therefore we fail to reject the null hypothesis. 
Therefore, there is no serial correlation present in the residuals. 

* BoxJenkins methodology

** Identification
ac  dmanufacturing, lags(12)
There are no significant lags present. Thus no model can be identified from it. 
pac  dmanufacturing, lags(12)

It is an AR model because it has a significant spikes through lag 10,  AR[10].

** Estimation and diagnostic checking
arima  dmanufacturing, arima(10,0,0)
predict resdmanufacturing, residuals
lmalb resdmanufacturing, lags(12)

The p-value, 0.9946, is greater than the 5% level of significance  Therefore, it is significant and does not lie within the confidence interval bounds. From this we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Hence, we conclude that there is no serial correlation, the residuals are white noise and they are stationary as desired.
